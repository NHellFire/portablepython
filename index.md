## What is Portable Python?
Portable Python is a [Python® programming language](http://Python.org/ "Python® programming language") pre-configured to run directly on the Windows OS from any USB storage device, enabling you to have, at any time, a portable programming environment. Just download it, extract to your portable storage device or hard drive and in 10 minutes you are ready to create your next Python® application.

### What is included?
Large set of third party python libraries - NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, PyWin32, Django, PIL, wxPython, PyQt, PyGame, etc.  code editors - PyCharm, PyScripter and IDLE all packaged in a single installer.

### Where can I use it?
Portable Python is intended for use on the Windows OS and can be installed directly on USB, network or local hard drive. Its powerful launchers do all the work of pre-configuring the Python environment before starting any of the built-in applications.

### What can I do with it?
Everything like with standard Python.org distribution and more as it includes additional libraries and tools. You can pack your Python web/desktop application together with the Portable Python on a USB stick and share with your friends, colleagues or customers. You can even customize entire Portable Python build and create your own custom distribution.

## Download
Portable Python is available in two flavors - based on Python 3 and Python 2. Distribution based on Python 3 usually contains less libraries due to the fact that support for Python 3 in the Python community is still work in progress.
